# TDS FIT
During my master's thesis Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) has played a central role. As a result, I have worked on a program able to fit TDS spectra with two different methods. One is simply solving the Kissinger equation for different trap energies (and frequency factor). The second one is by using TMAP7. This repository contains my python scripts to fit spectra to a given data set. In the figure below, an example of a TMAP7 fit on a generated data set is shown:
